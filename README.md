# Forecasting North-Eastern Home Values
# Data Source
We obtained our dataset from zillow and we downloaded the average price of a house per zipcode (all U.S. zipcodes) from January 31st, 2000 to August 31st, 2021

<b>Data Size:</b> Because our data is so big we decided not to load it onto our github. The data is over 35,000 rows and over 250 columns.

To download this data, please use this link https://www.zillow.com/research/data/, then change the 'Home Values' Geography to zipcode and download.
 
This is a csv file that gives us the average home values in the U.S. for each zipcode per month.

Our target is to forecast future home values in northeast to see which zipcodes would be good for investment purposes. 

Limitation on the dataset is that we don't know if there are any outliers in the average home values per zipcode or if there are any mistakes entered on behalf of the zipcode.
